Setup1:

Creates:

- 2 fictive Investor:
	username: Admin1
	password: admin
	
	username: Admin2
	password: admin

- 1 fictive FinancialManager:
	username: Admin
	password: admin

- 3 fictive Lead


The only purpose of this fictive instances are to show that the system works according to the
document i.e. fulfills its functionality.
We create this instances by directly/"manually" inserting them into the underlying DB. 	


Setup2:

Because we don't deal/manage Investor accounts in the current version but, still obligated to
some rational app logic and proof of concept to say the least we the following:
- we do not allow Investors to ASK on what they don't have, tracking this changes 
  using some POJO data structures and persistency.
- So again, for demonstration purposes we use Eyal's stock exchange client to issue some ASK commands
  to startup the simulation process i.e. the stock trading process. 


The above parts are not combined to one class to far debug and the test the system in other cases...
