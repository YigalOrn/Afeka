This is the rep' for my academic projects and other outcomes to share with potential recruiters and any other programmer out there.
For now, 30/04/18 the rep' is still empty!
The reason is that only now the significance of github is being appreciated by me and as far as I didnt have the chance in participating in a large scale project again I didnt have the opportunity to appreciate version control.....
Another reason is that many projects on academic level like HW may contain many many other stuff that is not directly relevent to the outcome itself i.e. the app/program....

What I ask you for now is to please bear with me while I upload all projects I have.
I will be done by tomorrow! 31/04

As I said the rep' will also contain presentations I made etc.

Hope you will enjoy my work and thanks for taking the time to look at it!
