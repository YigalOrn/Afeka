This is the rep' for my academic projects and other outcomes to share with potential employer/recruiter (and any other programmer out there).

More to come <<<<-----------------------

Pls Notice: 
*All material in this rep' are for display only!



*Some course directories dont contain programming projects/assignmnets and projects in general but,
 they contain HW/class assignmnets/lecture presentations etc. for potential employer/recruiter to get more insight
 for my set of skills. I expect this material to show deep understanding of the material that may come in hand and also,
 disclose subjects and sepcific areas that were tought in those courses and I can be of assistance depending 
 on compnay needs/ area of exeprtise.
