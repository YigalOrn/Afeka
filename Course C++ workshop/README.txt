Only if you recruit me to a C++ job....

Here is my Class work somehow very messy, sorry for that!

My primary knowledge of the language FYI is from:
- Dietel and Deitel C++ edition
- Keren Kalif great! great!! ppt that you can find at
  kerenkalif.com
- Bjarne stroustrup C++ book (read only part of it! :( )

For a C++ job be assured that all said in the first 2 sources
are well known by me and, as the  saying goes: practice makes perfect right?


The Exams in this dir was not written by me of course but the point at this course was to understand the flows, program logic etc.
So again be assured that I can deliver that too.
